# Fetch Data analysis excercise

# First: explore the data

For this section,  1) Launch the **Fetch_data_analysis.ipynb** file in jupyter notebook
2) Replace the file path as per your local path where the csv files are located for 3 files in this lines code **df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/purva/Documents/Fetch_data_analysis_excercise/data/TRANSACTION.csv')**
3) Run the file in your local machine to view analysis performed.
4) In the end 3 csv files will be generated, which represents cleaned dataset

# Second: provide SQL queries

1) Create a new database eg: "Fetch_data_analysis" in your SQL Server Management Studio
2) Import the 3 csv files into database by right clicking on DB --> Tasks --> Import Flat file. Each files should be imported successfully. The cleaned files that needs to be imported can be accessed from this github repo in this path **path** else it can also be accessed in your local repo after python file is executed.
3) After that execute the queries that are present in the file **path.sql** in the session that is open currently for your database.
4) **path.docx** has word doc representing the output of the queries that I achieved after executing in my local machine.
   
# Third: communicate with stakeholders

1) Refer **path.docx** for the stakeholder email
