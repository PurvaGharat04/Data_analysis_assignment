# Fetch Data analysis excercise

# First: explore the data

1) Launch the **Fetch_data_analysis_final.ipynb** file in jupyter notebook.
2) Replace the file path as per your local path where the csv files are located for those 3 files in this line of code in the python file **df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/purva/Documents/Fetch_data_analysis_excercise/data/TRANSACTION.csv')** replace for all 3 files.
3) Run the file in your local machine to view the analysis performed.
4) In the end 3 csv files will be generated, which represents cleaned dataset.

# Second: provide SQL queries

1) Create a new database eg: "Fetch_data_analysis" in your SQL Server Management Studio
2) Import the 3 csv cleaned files into database by right clicking on DB --> Tasks --> Import Flat file. Each files should be imported successfully. The cleaned files that needs to be imported can be accessed in your local repo after python file is executed.
3) After that execute the queries that are present in the file **Fetch_SQL_queries.sql** in the session that is open currently for your database.
4) **SQL_queries_output.pdf** has word doc representing the output of the queries that I achieved.
